# Databases Project: A Project Management System

## Project Description
Write a script to initialize the database (table creation) on a MySQL server. Then write the scripts corresponding to a Web interface for accessing the created database. You will use PHP and its PDO API. The user interface should enable operations to be carried out while always respecting the consistency of the database. The interface will include access control based on a user and password (the ones you will be given to connect to the MySQL database). Users who have logged in correctly will have access to a main menu enabling them to perform various operations.
